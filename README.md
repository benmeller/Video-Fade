# Video-Fade

A quick way to add fades to the start and end of video clips without needing to open up a video editor.

## Usage

```
vfade.py FILENAME
```

Everything else is hard-coded into the script. Still need to clean that up. But if you want to change something, that's how for now.

## To Do

* Implement argparse with configurable options such as:
    * Fade durations
    * Start and end time of clips
    * Cut multiple clips from single video
